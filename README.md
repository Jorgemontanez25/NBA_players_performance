## 📦 Dataset: NBA Database (Kaggle)

For this project, I use the **NBA Database** dataset from Kaggle — a comprehensive, historical dataset containing professional NBA game and player statistics.

🔗 Dataset source:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball

### Dataset Overview
- 🏀 **30 NBA teams**
- 👤 **4,800+ players**
- 📆 **65,000+ games**, dating back to the **1946–47 NBA season**
- 📊 Detailed **box scores** and statistical records
- 📋 Multiple related tables including player stats, team information, and game outcomes

This rich dataset enables analyses such as:
- Player performance trends across seasons
- Game outcome patterns and team comparisons
- Advanced statistical exploration and visualization
- Potential predictive modeling for wins and losses

The data is provided in **SQL and CSV formats**, making it well-suited for analysis using Python tools such as Pandas and SQLite.
